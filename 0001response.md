To launch TRACE32 PowerView on Windows, Linux, or macOS without the graphical user interface (GUI), you have two options (make sure to enter everything exactly as shown, with correct case):
1.	Use the command line option --t32-screen=off, e.g. 
```
t32arm.exe --t32-screen=off
```
2.	Alternatively, add the line `SCREEN=OFF` to your config.t32 configuration file.

Running TRACE32 PowerView without a GUI can be particularly useful for test automation.
